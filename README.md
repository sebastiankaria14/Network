Network Lab – TCL Scripting for Network Simulation
This repository contains basic Tcl scripts designed to simulate simple network topologies and perform fundamental networking operations. It serves as an introductory resource for understanding network simulation concepts using tools like NS2/NS3. The scripts demonstrate node creation, link establishment, traffic generation, and basic performance analysis. This project is ideal for students and beginners exploring network design and simulation.
